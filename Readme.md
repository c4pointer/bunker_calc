# BunkerCalc App

## Overview

BunkerCalc is a Python-based application built using the Kivy MD (Material Design) framework. It assists marine engineers in calculating the quantity of bunkering fuel required for a given voyage. By providing essential input parameters, the application helps estimate the fuel quantity needed, optimizing fuel management for marine vessels.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface accessible for marine engineers of all technical levels.
- **Input Parameters**: Users can input voyage details such as distance, speed, and fuel consumption rate.
- **Fuel Quantity Calculation**: Accurately estimates required bunkering fuel quantity based on input parameters.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Provides recommendations for efficient fuel management.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Kivy MD framework
